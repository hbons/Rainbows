This is an attempt to create a backend designed specifically 
for SparkleShare's use case to balance out the disadvantages of
using Git which is the current default in SparkleShare.

It takes inspiration and ideas from both Git and Syncany.

Benefits:
	- Limiting local history to a period
	- Restoring/reverting to file revisions that are not
          in the local history anymore but are on the host
	- Client side encryption
	- Resumable transfers
        - Using any kind of storage with write access
